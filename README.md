# Notepad
It is a Notepad application developed in Java programming language, JAVA swing is used.
This project is being made to practice java. The main idea of the project was to practice data structure in java but as I kept going on this project "Swing" swung most of the problems which were supposed to be solved using Data Structures.

So the purpose of various file are:
1. GUI.java - this file is the main file. The constructor in this file calls all the functions which are responsible for this project's functioning. 
2. functionColor.java - this is the theme file which contains the themes for the project it is fairly easy to add various extra themes to the project(once you understand the code).
3. functionEdit.java - it contains the undo-redo functions of notepad.
4. FunctonFile.java - this contains the functions of the "File" option in the menubar.
5. functionFormat.java - this contains the "Word Wrap" functionality along with font and font size functions.
6. keyHandler.java - this binds the keyboard keys to most command functions in the application like undo, redo, open, save, saveAs, themes for easier operations.

ps - I didn't add descriptions of any function individually. It would be too much if I type everything. sorry for the inconvenience.
